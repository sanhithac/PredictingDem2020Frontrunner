# PredictingDem2020Frontrunner

The goal of our project is to analyze the sentiment towards the American presidential frontrunners from 2008 to 2016. This would be Obama versus Mccain in 2008, Obama vs Romney in 2012, and Trump vs Clinton in 2016. Weâ€™re mostly going to be analyzing data from the past three elections because political sentiments have changed a lot in those years and using data from prior elections would incorrectly skew the general public sentiment. Using data from the Twitter and New York Times APIs, we will find the words most used to describe and talk about the nominees to find the general sentiment of the public towards them. 

We will perform parts of speech analysis in the sentences where the nominees are mentioned and keep track of what words are most used to describe the eventual presidential frontrunners. Furthermore, we would combine the APIs with Natural Language Toolkit to analyze the sentiment towards our given subject; in this case the subject would be presidential nominees. This analysis will give us insight about what kind of candidates are favorably viewed by the general public and what common characteristics they possess. This could help predict who might be the Democratic frontrunners in the 2020 election.
